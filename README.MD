## 🚀 About

This project was built to bridge the gap between a refined visual identity and functional programming. It allows users to define a numeric range, choose the quantity of numbers, and decide whether results can be repeated or not.

> **"Turning logic into a visual experience."**

---

## ✨ Features

* **Custom Range:** Set minimum and maximum values for the draw.
* **Quantity Control:** Choose how many numbers to generate at once.
* **Non-Repeat Option:** Toggle button to ensure unique results in every draw.
* **Dynamic Animations:** Numbers are displayed with a sequential "spinning" effect for better engagement.
* **Smart UI:** The "Try Again" button only appears after the full animation sequence finishes, preventing UI glitches.

## 🎨 Design & Dev Challenges

Being a **Designer transitioning to Front-end**, this project was a significant milestone:

* **CSS Compatibility:** Handled and solved issues with modern CSS Nesting on older browsers (like iOS 15/iPhone SE), refactoring to a robust "Flat CSS" structure.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically creating, styling, and animating elements based on user input.
* **Sequential Delays:** Implementing precise `setTimeout` and `animationDelay` logic to ensure a smooth reveal of results.
* **Asset Management:** Resolving issues with SVG rendering and ensuring icons are correctly positioned within input fields.

## 🛠 Technologies

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and accessibility.
* **CSS3:** Advanced gradients, transitions, and keyframe animations.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Array manipulation, event handling, and custom animation triggers.
* **Figma:** Original design reference and brand adjustments.
